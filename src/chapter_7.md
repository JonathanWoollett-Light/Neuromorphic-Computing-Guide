## NLP Learning Resources

[Natural Language Processing (NLP)](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/natural-language-processing) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on giving computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can. NLP combines computational linguistics rule-based modeling of human language with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models.
